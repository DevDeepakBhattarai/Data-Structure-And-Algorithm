# Quick Sort Implementation in C

This repository contains a C implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that is widely used due to its efficiency. It works by recursively partitioning an array into smaller subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

## Code Overview

The code consists of two main functions:

- `partition`: This function partitions the array into two subarrays based on a pivot element. The pivot is chosen as the first element of the array. The function iterates through the array, comparing each element with the pivot. Elements less than the pivot are placed in the left subarray, while elements greater than the pivot are placed in the right subarray.

```c
int partition(int* A, int low, int high) {
    int i = low + 1, j = high, temp;
    int pivot = A[low];

    do {

        while (A[i] <= pivot) {
            i++;
        }

        while (A[j] > pivot) {
            j--;
        }

        if (i < j) {
            temp = A[i];
            A[i] = A[j];
            A[j] = temp;
        }

    } while (j >= i);

    temp = A[j];
    A[j] = A[low];
    A[low] = temp;

    return j;
}
```

- `QuickSort`: This function recursively applies the partition function to sort the entire array. It first calls the `partition` function to divide the array into two subarrays. Then, it recursively calls itself on the left and right subarrays until the entire array is sorted.

```c
void QuickSort(int* A, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int position = partition(A, low, high);
        QuickSort(A, position + 1, high);
        QuickSort(A, low, position - 1);
    }
}
```

## Usage

To use the Quick Sort algorithm, simply call the `QuickSort` function with the array to be sorted, the starting index, and the ending index. The function will sort the array in ascending order.

```c
int main() {
    int A[] = { 1,5
